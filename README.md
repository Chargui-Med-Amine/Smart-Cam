# Smart-Cam
# Problematic
# Normal surveillance cameras are passive, they require someone to look through them. Artificial intelligence is giving surveillance cameras digital brains to match their eyes, letting them analyze live video with no
# human intervention.
# Description
# Our project consists of developing a Smart-Cam. This surveillance camera, based on artificial intelligence, is able to analyze and interpret the images it captures in order to tighten the security
# and assure that the health protocol is respected.
# Technology
# This project is built using the python language, TensorFlow and Dlib for machine learnin models, OpenCV for Image  processing, Multiprocessing for optimization and Tkinter for the GUI.
