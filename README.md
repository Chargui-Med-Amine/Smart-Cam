# Smart-Cam
This project is part of the "Association Robotique Ensi" ARE's internal projects for 2020/2021. It can be deployed in public spaces such as classrooms and companies.
**********************************
## Problematic
Normal surveillance cameras are passive, they require someone to look through them. Artificial intelligence is giving surveillance cameras digital brains to match their eyes, letting them analyze live video with no human intervention.
## Description
Our project consists of developing a Smart-Cam. This surveillance camera, based on artificial intelligence, is able to analyze and interpret the images it captures in order to tighten the security and assure that the health protocol is respected.
## Technology
This project is built using the python language, TensorFlow and Dlib for machine learnin models, OpenCV for Image  processing, Multiprocessing for optimization and Tkinter for the GUI.

 The project was divided into three parts
****************************************

## Face Recognition Algorithm


Built using Dlib's highly accurate face recognition model, OpenCV and Multiprocessing.

Through this algorithm, our Smart-cam is capable of detecting and  identifying the faces of persons who have access to the space.

In case of unknown person, the camera captures an image of their face and saves it in a specified folder.

## Mask Detection Algorithm

Face Mask Detection system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in real-time video streams to ensure safety.

## Door State Detection Algorithm

Using a trained Keras/TensorFlow model, OpenCV and Computer Vision concepts,
this algorithm is capable of detecting the Door state (closed/open).
